# The Myth of Neutrality in Recommender Systems

 

Recommender systems are often presented as neutral instruments—simply matching users with content they are statistically most likely to enjoy. However, this misconception of neutrality obscures the truth: these systems are engineered systematically for audience building, which in turn promotes polarizing, emotional, or non-verifiable content. Zeynep Tufekci's article illustrates this clearly in the context of YouTube. A viewer consuming political content or health information can suddenly find themselves nudged towards conspiratorial or extremist material, not as a result of algorithmic "bias" in the traditional sense, but simply because radical content performs better given the current reward structure. The algorithm works as designed.

This underscores a further issue, the algorithmic bias is not solely entrenched in the data, nor is it merely in the model. The objective function has a bias. Algorithms that are designed to maximize watch-time (or clicks), will naturally converge towards a platform space under whatever keeps viewers' attention—this will often be outrage or fear. The radical content is not a bug, it's a feature.

These objectives codify present-day business values into the award structure for the recommender systems.
